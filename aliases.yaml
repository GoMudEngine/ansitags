# Aliases are a way to custom name values for ansi tag properties.
# For example, you may want to always use the same color when displaying dates, 
# so you may defined a "date" color that is an alias for the color "magenta".
# Property names themselves cannot be aliases. For example, in "<ansi fg="yellow">Text</ansi>"
# "fg" cannot be an alias, but the value of "fg" (yellow) can be aliased to another name.
#
# All names and values can only be the following character sets:
# a-z 
# 0-9 
# ,_-
#
# Aliases are organized into groups, only the following groups are valid:
# color - for foreground and background colors
# position - for cursor x,y position
#
color:
  date: magenta
  username: cyan
position:
  topleft: 1,1
  bottomleft: 1,999
  bottomright: 999,999
  topright: 999,1
